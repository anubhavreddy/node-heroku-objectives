Objective 2 - Create a Chat App
====================================

Follow the socket.io chat application tutorial below to make a chat application. Submit a pull request with your application living in a directory inside the Objective 2 folder.

This app only needs to run locally. I should be able to clone the repo, run npm install, then node app.js, and your app should just work.
